<h1 id="split-keyboards">Split Keyboards</h1>
<p>This is an interactive gallery of split keyboards, based on an <a href="https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards">earlier list by diimdeep</a>.</p>
<p>The keyboards included are mechanical and have either two halves ar a “wedge” in the middle to allow the wrists to lie in a more natural position. Many are available for purchase, either assembled or in kit form. Some only have the source (plans) available, which means making (or ordering from a service) the circuit board and case from a manufacturer yourself.</p>
<p>A good resource for mass produced, membrane (non-mechanical) keyboards is <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards_index.html">Xah-Lee’s Ergonomic Keyboard Reviews</a>.</p>
<p>The mechanical keyboards shown on this site are further classified as follows:</p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Traditional</dt>
<dd>traditional ergonomic keyboard; the normal layout with a wedge in the middle.
</dd>
<dt>Ortholinear</dt>
<dd>keys placed in a grid or near-grid.
</dd>
<dt>Ergonomic</dt>
<dd>keys usually staggered by column rather than row, and almost always including thumb keys.
</dd>
<dt>Dished</dt>
<dd>a shaped keyboard with thumbkeys and dishes or wells for the fingers.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="number-of-keys">Number of keys</h3>
<p>The minimum and maximum number of keys supported by the keyboard. Some keyboards can be assembled with a different number of keys (for example, using a double-height key instead of two single-height keys). Other keyboards are available with several variations on the design. In either case, the filter is based on the maximum.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Two halves</dt>
<dd>two independent parts to the keyboard
</dd>
<dt>Rotary encoder</dt>
<dd>one or more knobs which can press keys, useful for volume up/down, page-up/page-down, etc.
</dd>
<dt>Trackball/point/trackpad</dt>
<dd>an integrated trackball, laptop-syle trackpoint, or trackpad mouse.
</dd>
<dt>Display</dt>
<dd>a display on the keyboard, which can show status (Caps Lock, current layer, macros etc)
</dd>
<dt>Wireless</dt>
<dd>no wires!
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Mass produced</dt>
<dd>Reliably in-stock for immediate delivery.
</dd>
<dd>Probably includes a GUI or other professional tool for configuring keyboard layout, macros etc.
</dd>
<dt>Assembled</dt>
<dd>Available for purchase pre-assembled and programmed.
</dd>
<dd>To distinguish this from the following categories, it omits keyboards where individuals are willing to assemble a kit for others — otherwise there’s little point to the filter. A company should be willing to buy an “assembled” keyboard for an employee, but less likely to ask someone on Reddit to solder a kit (below) for them.
</dd>
<dt>Kit</dt>
<dd>Kit (circuit boards, cases, components etc) available to purchase.
</dd>
<dd>Some people will assemble a kit for you, for a fee.
</dd>
<dt>Plans (source)</dt>
<dd>Open source keyboards, where files defining the PCB and case are available. Sometimes, a group of people will order circuit boards and/or cases together to save costs, this is a <em>group buy</em>.
</dd>
<dt>Unavailable</dt>
<dd>The keyboard is no longer available, and was not open source
</dd>
</dl>
